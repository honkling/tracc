When configuring the bot (in config.json), you will come across several options.

**discord_channel_id** The id of the channel you want the bot to send chat messages to. You can retrieve the id of a channel by right clicking on a channel, and clicking "Copy ID". Must have Developer Mode enabled.
**bot_token** The token of the discord bot. You can create one by going to https://discord.com/developers/applications/me, clicking "New Application", navigating to the "Bot" section, clicking "Create New Bot", and then copying the bot's token.
**your_id** The id of your discord account. You can retrieve it by right clicking on your avatar in a message, and clicking "Copy Id".
**minecraft_email** & **minecraft_password** Your minecraft account details
**server** When your bot joins Minehut, it will try to automatically join the server specified, if you don't want it to join a server, leave this option blank.

You can make your account talk via the bot by typing in the channel specified in discord_channel_id. To run a command, say "/(whatever command and whatever arguments)"
